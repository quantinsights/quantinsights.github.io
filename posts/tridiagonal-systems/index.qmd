The special case of a system of linear equations that is *tridiagonal*, that is, has non-zero elements only on the diagonal plus or minus one column, is one that occurs frequently. Also common are systems that are *band-diagonal*, with non-zero elements only along a few diagonal lines adjacent to the main diagonal (above and below).

For triadiagonal sets, the procedures $LU$-decomposition, forward- and back- substitution each take only $O(n)$ operations and the whole solution can be coded very concisely. In this blog post, I am going to explore solving triadiagonal matrix systems. I closely follow Daniel Duffy's exposition in *Chapter 13* of his excellent book [Financial Instrument Pricing using C++](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Financial-Instrument-Pricing-Using-Finance-ebook/dp/B07H51DPQP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=35L1ITLEUA1S&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FeGDbbRPp2NQKdDQycirWzCkF5j0TlM92l9p6jCKk-U.9ZQRlCNBa5pshnZTad_fcM8KxN4SyD60z1tCbwwwE-g&dib_tag=se&keywords=Financial+Instrument+Pricing+Using+C%2B%2B&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1731655789&sprefix=financial+instrument+pricing+using+c%2B%2B%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-1).

Let $A$ be a $m \times n$ general banded matrix with $kl$ subdiagonals and $ku$ superdiagonals. Then, $a_{ij}=0$, when $|i - j| > kl + ku  + 1$. All non-zero elements are positioned on the main diagonal, $kl$ subdiagonals below it and $ku$ superdiagonals above it. 

- A *diagonal* matrix is a $n \times n$ band matrix with $kl = ku = 0$.
- A *Toeplitz* matrix is a $n \times n$ band matrix $T_n=[t_{k,j};k,j=0,1,\ldots,n-1]$ where $t_{k,j}=t_{k-j}$. That is, a matrix of the form:
$$
T_n = \begin{bmatrix}
t_0 & t_{-1} & t_{-2} & \ldots & t_{-(n-1)}\\
t_1 & t_0 & t_{-1} & \ldots & t_{-(n-2)}\\
t_2 & t_1 & t_{0} & \ldots & t_{-(n-3)}\\
\vdots & & & \ddots & \\
t_{n-1} & t_{n-2} & t_{n-3} & \ldots & t_{0}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- A *tridiagonal* (Jacobi) matrix is a $n \times n$ band matrix of width three $kl = ku = 1$. 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & c_0 & 0 & \ldots \\
a_1 & b_1 & c_1 & \ldots \\
0 & a_2 & b_2 & \ldots \\
& & & \ldots \\
& & & \ldots & a_{n-2} & b_{n-2} & c_{n-2}\\
& & & \ldots & 0 & a_{n-1} & b_{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Consider a two-point boundary value problem on the interval $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2} &= f(x), \quad 0 < x < 1\\
u(0) &= \phi, \\
u(1) &= \psi 
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-two-point-bvp}

We approximate the solution $u$ by creating a *discrete mesh of points* defined by $\{x_j\}$, $j=0,\ldots,J$ where $J$ is a positive integer. At each interior mesh point the second derivative in the @eq-two-point-bvp can be approximated by a second-order divided difference. The

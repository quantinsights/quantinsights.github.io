Hi there! Welcome to my blog. I'm Quasar and I'm excited to share my self-learning journey with you. Over the years, I have delved into various topics in C++ programming and mathematical finance. 

Throughout my career, I have transitioned from different roles, eventually becoming an analyst and a now a sell-side quant. Driven by a spirit of enquiry, I am embarking on a self-learning path exploring modern C++ and quantitative finance. Through this blog, my goal is to provide clear and efficient explanations of various topics, offering insights that I wish I had when I started my self-learning journey.

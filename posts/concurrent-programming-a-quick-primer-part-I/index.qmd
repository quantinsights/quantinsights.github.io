## An Introduction

When we talk about concurrency in terms of computers, I mean a single system performing multiple independent activities in parallel, rather than sequentially, or one after the other. Historically, most desktop computers have had one processor, with a single processing unit or core, and this remains true for many desktop machines today. Such a machine can only perform one task at a time, but it can switch between tasks many times per second. By doing a bit of one task, then a bit of another and so on, it appears that the tasks are happening concurrently. This is called *task switching*.

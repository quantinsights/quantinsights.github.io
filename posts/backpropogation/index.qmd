## Calculating the network error with Loss

With a randomly initialized model, or even a model initialized with more sophisticated approaches, our goal is to train, or teach a model over time. To train a model, we tweak the weights and biases to improve the model's accuracy and confidence. To do this, we calculate the error in our model. The *loss function* also referred to as the *cost function* quantifies the error.

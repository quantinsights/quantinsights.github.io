## The Markov Property for Diffusions

Let's start by exhibiting the Markov property of Brownian motion. To see this, consider $(\mathcal{F}_t,t\geq 0)$, the natural filtration of the Brownian motion $(B_t,t\geq 0)$. Consider $g(B_t)$ for some time $t$ and bounded function $g$. (For example, $g$ could be an indicator function.) Consider also a random variable $W$ that is $\mathcal{F}_s$ measurable for $s < t$. (For example, $W$ could be $B_s$ or $1_{B_s > 0}$.) Let's compute $\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)W]$.

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)W] &= \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[Wg(B_t - B_s + B_s)|\mathcal{F}_s]]
\end{align*}

The random variable $(B_t - B_s)$ follows a $\mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$ distribution. By LOTUS,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)W] 
&= \int_0^t \mathbb{E}[W g(y + B_s)|\mathcal{F_s}]f_{(B_t - B_s)|B_s}(y) dy\\
&= \{\text{ Using the fact that }B_t - B_s \perp B_s\}\\
&= \int_0^t \mathbb{E}[W g(y + B_s)]f_{(B_t - B_s)}(y)dy\\
&= \int_0^t \mathbb{E}[W g(y + B_s)]\frac{e^{-\frac{y^2}{2(t-s)}}}{\sqrt{2\pi(t-s)}}dy
\end{align*}

By Fubini's theorem, the integral and the expectation operator can be interchanged, and since $W$ is $\mathcal{F}_s$ measurable, it follows from the definition of conditional expectations that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|\mathcal{F}_s] &= \int_0^t g(y + B_s) \frac{e^{-\frac{y^2}{2(t-s)}}}{\sqrt{2\pi(t-s)}}dy
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-conditional-expectation-of-function-brownian-motion}

We make two important observations. First, the right hand side is a function of $s,t$ and $B_s$ only (and not of the Brownian motion before time s). In particular, we have:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|\mathcal{F}_s] = \mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|B_s]
$$

This holds for any bounded function $g$. In particular, it holds for all indicator functions. This implies that the conditional distribution of $B_t$ given $\mathcal{F}_s$ depends solely on $B_s$, and not on other values before time $s$. Second, the right-hand side is *time-homogenous* in the sense that it depends on the time difference $t-s$. 

We have just shown that Brownian motion is a *time-homogenous Markov process*.

### Markov process.

Consider a stochastic process $(X_t,t\geq 0)$ and its natural filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t,t\geq 0)$. It is said to be a *Markov process* if and only if for any (bounded) function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, we have:

$$
\mathbb{E}[g(X_t) | \mathcal{F}_s] = \mathbb{E}[g(X_t) | X_s], \quad \forall t \geq 0, \forall s \leq t
$$ {#eq-markov-process}

:::

This implies that $\mathbb{E}[g(X_t)|\mathcal{F}_s]$ is an explicit function of $s$, $t$ and $X_s$. It is said to be *time-homogenous*, if it is a function of $t-s$ and $X_s$. Since the above holds for all bounded $g$, the conditional distribution of $X_t$ given $\mathcal{F}_s$ is the same as the conditional distribution of $X_t$ given $X_s$.

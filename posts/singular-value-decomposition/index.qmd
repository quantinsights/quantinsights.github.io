Rectangular matrices do not have eigenvalues. However, we might look at the eigenvalues of the symmetric, positive semidefinite square Gram matrix $K=AA^T$. Perhaps the eigenvalues of $K$ might form an important role for general matrices. They were first studied by the German mathematician [Erhard Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Schmidt) in early days of the 20th century.

### Singular Values

The *singular values* $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r$ of a rectangular matrix $A\in \mathbf{R}^{m \times n}$ are the positive square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i} > 0$ of the non-zero eigenvalues of the Gram matrix $K = AA^T$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as the *singular* vectors of $A$.

Since $K=AA^T$ is necessarily positive semi-definite, its eigenvalues are necessarily non-negative, $\lambda_i \geq 0$, which justifies the positivity of the singular values of $A$ - independently of whether $A$ itself has positive, negative or even complex eigenvalues, or is rectangular and has no eigenvalues at all. I will follow the standard convention, and always label the singular values in decreasing order, so that $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_r$. 

In the special case of symmetric matrices, there is a direct connection between their singular values and their (necessarily real) eigenvalues.

::: {#prp-singular-values-of-a-symmetric-matrix}

If $A = A^T$ is a symmetric matrix, its singular values are the absolute values of its nonzero eigenvalues : $\sigma_i = |\lambda_i| > 0$; its singular vectors coincide with its non-null eigenvectors.
:::

*Proof.*

When $A$ is symmetric, $K=A^T A = A^2$. So, if 

$$
A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
$$

then 

$$
K \mathbf{v} = A^2 \mathbf{v} = A(A \mathbf{v}) = A(\lambda \mathbf{v}) = \lambda A \mathbf{v} = \lambda^2 \mathbf{v}
$$

Thus, every eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ of $A$ is also an eigenvector of $K$ with eigenvalue $\lambda^2$. So, the eigenvector basis of $A$ is also an eigenvector basis for $K$, and forms a complete system of singular vectors for $A$. $\blacksquare$

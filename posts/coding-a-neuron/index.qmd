## Introduction

In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts introduced artificial intelligence to the world. Their idea was to develop an algorithmic approach to mimic the functionality of the human brain. Due to the structure of the brain consisting of a net of neurons, they introduced the so-called *artificial neurons* as building blocks.

 In it's most simple form, the neuron consists of :

- dendrites, which receive the information from other neurons
- soma, which processes the information
- synapse, transmits the output of this neuron
- axon, point of connection to other neurons

Consequently, a mathematical definition of an artificial neuron is as follows. 

*Definition.* An *artificial neuron* with weights $w_1,\ldots,w_n \in \mathbf{R}$, bias $b\in\mathbf{R}$ and an activation function $\rho:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$ is defined as the scalar-valued function $f:\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}$ given by:

\begin{align*}
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \rho \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i x_i + b\right) = \rho(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}+b) \tag{1}
\end{align*}

where $\mathbf{w} = (w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ and $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.

A single neuron by itself is useless, but when combined with hundreds or thousands(or many more) of other neurons, the interconnectivity can approximate any complex function and frequently outperforms any other machine learning methods.

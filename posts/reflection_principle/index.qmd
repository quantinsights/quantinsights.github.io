It is an amazing fact, that some simple manipulations using stopping time yield the complete distribution of the first passage time $\tau_a$ of a Brownian motion as well as the distribution of the running maximum of the Brownian path on an interval of time $[0,T]$. This is surprising since the maximum of the Brownian path on $[0,T]$, denoted by $\sup_{0\leq t \leq T} B_t$ is a random variable that depends on the whole path on $[0,T]$. This beautiful result is due to Bachelier.

*Proposition 1.* (*Bachelier's formula*) Let $(B_t,t\leq T)$ be a standard Brownian motion on $[0,T]$. Then, the CDF of the random variable $\sup_{0 \leq t\leq T} B_t$ is:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{0\leq t \leq T} B_t \leq a\right) = \mathbb{P}(|B_T| \leq a) \quad \text{ for any }a\geq 0
\end{align*}

In particular, its PDF is:

\begin{align*}
f_{max}(a) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi T}} e^{-a^2/2T}
\end{align*}

In other words, the random variable $\sup_{0 \leq t \leq T} B_t$ has the same distribution as $|B_T|$.

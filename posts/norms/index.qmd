# Norms

Very often, to quantify errors or measure distances one needs to compute the magnitude(length) of a vector or a matrix. Norms are a mathematical generalization(abstraction) for length. 

## Vector Norms

### Vector norm 
Let $\nu:\mathbf{C}^m \to \mathbf{R}$. Then, $\nu$ is a (vector) norm if for all $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in \mathbf{C}^m$ and for all $\alpha \in \mathbf{C}$, $\nu(\cdot)$ satisfies:

#### Positive Semi-Definiteness

$$\nu(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0, \quad \forall \bf{x}\in\bf{C}^n$$ 

and 

$$\nu(\mathbf{x})=0 \Longleftrightarrow \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$$

#### Homogeneity

$$\nu(\alpha \mathbf{x}) = |\alpha|\nu(\mathbf{x})$$

#### Triangle inequality

$$\nu(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}) \leq \nu(\mathbf{x}) + \nu(\mathbf{y})$$

### The vector $2-$norm

The length of a vector is most commonly measured by the *square root of the sum of the squares of the components of the vector*, also known as the *euclidean norm*.

### Vector $2-$norm

The vector $2-$ norm, $||\cdot||:\mathbf{C}^m \to \mathbf{R}$ is defined for $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{C}^n$ by:

$$
\norm{\bf{x}}_2 =\sqrt{|\chi_1|^2 + |\chi_2|^2 + |\chi_n|^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n |\chi_i^2|}
$$

Equivalently, it can be defined as:

$$
\norm{\bf{x}}_2 = (\bf{x}^H \bf{x})^{1/2} = \sqrt{\overline{\chi_1}\chi_1 +\overline{\chi_2}\chi_2+\ldots+\overline{\chi_n}\chi_n}
$$

To prove that the vector $2-$norm is indeed a valid norm(just calling it a norm, doesn't mean it is, after all), we need a result known as the Cauchy-Sch

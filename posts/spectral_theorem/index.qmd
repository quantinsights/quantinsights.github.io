### Spectral Theorem

Every real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable.

Let $A$ be a $n \times n$ real symmetric matrix. Then, 

1) The eigenvalues of $A$ are real.
2) There exists an orthonormal basis $\{\mathbf{q}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{q}_n\}$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of the eigenvectors of $A$. That is, there is an orthogonal matrix $Q$ so that $A = QAQ^{-1}$.

*Proof.* 

(I) Before we get to the proof, note that for any square matrix $A$, we have:

$$
A\mathbf{x}
$$
